          type: string
        description: >-
               Specifies the maximum rate at which a client associated with this Client Connection Policy may issue requests to the Directory Server.

        type: string
        description: >-
               Specifies the maximum length of time that a connection associated with this Client Connection Policy may be established. Any connection which is associated with this Client Connection Policy and has been established for longer than this period of time may be terminated.

        description: >-
               Specifies the order in which Client Connection Policy definitions will be evaluated.

        description: >-
               Specifies the behavior that the Directory Server should exhibit if a client connection attempts to exceed a rate defined in the maximum-policy-operation-rate property. If the configured behavior is one that will reject requested operations, then that behavior will persist until the end of the corresponding interval.

        type: integer
        description: >-

               Specifies the maximum length of time that the server should wait for an outstanding operation to complete before rejecting a new request received when the maximum number of outstanding operations are already in progress on that connection. If an existing outstanding operation on the connection completes before this time, then the operation will be processed. Otherwise, the operation will be rejected with a "busy" result.

        type: integer
        description: >-
               Specifies the maximum number of concurrent operations that can be in progress for any connection. This can help prevent a single client connection from monopolizing server processing resources by sending a large number of concurrent asynchronous requests. A value of zero indicates that no limit will be placed on the number of concurrent requests for a single client.

        description: >-
               Indicates whether clients will be allowed to request search operations that cannot be efficiently processed using the set of indexes defined in the corresponding backend. Note that even if this is false, some clients may be able to request unindexed searches if the allow-unindexed-searches-with-control property has a value of true and the necessary conditions are satisfied.
