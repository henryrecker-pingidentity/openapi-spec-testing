Values should be in the format HH:MM (where HH is a two-digit representation of the hour of the day, between 00 and 23, inclusive), and MM is a two-digit representation of the minute of the hour (between 00 and 59, inclusive). Alternately, the value can be in the form *:MM, which indicates that the task should be eligible to start at the specified minute of every hour. At least one value must be provided, but multiple values may be given to indicate multiple start times within the same day.

        description: >-
               Indicates whether this Recurring Task Chain is enabled for use. Recurring Task Chains that are disabled will not have any new instances scheduled, but instances that are already scheduled will be preserved. Those instances may be manually canceled if desired.
